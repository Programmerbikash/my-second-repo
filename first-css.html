    <h2>We fail to understand the role of the police in these incidents.</h2>
    <p>Their failure to act properly and responsibly only makes the consequent experience more traumatic. Also, in Narail, it didn't help that both teacher and student had a minority religion in common, which further angered their majoritarian tormentors – a pattern of marginalisation that deserves scrutiny. Teachers must be given all the safety they need, especially while on campus</p>
    <p id="teacher"> But let's not lose sight of the bigger picture here: the crumbling of social values as well as increasing vulnerability of teachers who want to do their job with sincerity. Add to that the suffocating environment that prevails in most public universities and colleges thanks to their politicisation.</p>
    <p class="treated">In a statement condemning the attacks, the University Teachers' Network also decried this environment, saying that teachers are often being harassed and assaulted, which is partly to blame for the poor state of education in Bangladesh. Teachers must be given all the safety they need, especially while on campus, and those who endanger</p>
    <p>This is a bad sign for a country trying to develop a knowledge-based society to face the challenges of the future. We urge the authorities to help create an environment in which teachers are properly treated, protected, rewarded, and empowered to do their nation-building work. Teachers must be given all the safety they need, especially while on campus, and those who endanger</p>
    <p class="treated">While the nation's attention was fixed on the inauguration of the Padma Bridge – a milestone in our development history – a teacher was assaulted by students and local people in the Narail district. The incident only came to our notice after a video of the teacher being forced to wear a garland of shoes around his neck went viral on social media.</p>
