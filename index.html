        <p>Chittagong has several hospitals, an ethnological museum, and many institutions of higher education, of which the University of Chittagong (1966) and Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology (1968) are the most prominent. Nearby are a cadet college (at Faujdar Hat) and a merchant-marine academy. The Zia Memorial Museum (established 1993) preserves the location where Bangladeshi leader Ziaur Rahman was assassinated in 1981.</p>

        <p>Then, on June 25, a teacher in Ashulia was beaten to death by a student apparently incensed by his disciplinary measures. Regardless of the circumstances of these events, the fact that such cruelty could be meted out to teachers, of all people, is deeply concerning. There have been some disturbing revelations since the two events came to our notice. In Narail, for example, the shoe incident reportedly occurred right before the eyes of the police.</p>

        <h3>No teacher should have to suffer such barbarity</h3>
        <small>Author: <span class="author-name">Bikash Chandra Dey</span></small>
        <p>We're alarmed by the recent series of attacks on teachers that saw at least two brutalised within the space of a week. First, there was a college principal in Narail Sadar Upazila who, on June 18, was forced to wear a garland of shoes for apparently trying to protect a student who ran into trouble after a Facebook post backing a controversial leader of India's ruling party. Apparently, the deputy commissioner (DC) and superintendent of police (SP) were present on the scene. There were also announcements made via a microphone of the principal's impending humiliation, yet no one came forward to save him. </p>
